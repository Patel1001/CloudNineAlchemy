This weather website was created as a side project duing my 1st year doing computer science where I just wanted to create a simple app which uses some APIS and where I can get some practice in HTML, CSS and JS.


 ## Description
 
The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather in any city around the world. The app fetches weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays information such as temperature, weather description, humidity, and the city name.

## Features
Search Functionality: Users can input a city name in the search bar and get real-time weather information.

Dynamic Background: The background of the app changes based on the searched city, displaying a related image from Unsplash.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Structuring the web content.

CSS: Styling the app for a visually appealing interface.

JavaScript: Fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and dynamically updating the UI.

## How to Use

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

Enter the name of the city you want to check the weather for in the search bar.

Press Enter or click the search button to see the weather information for the specified city.
