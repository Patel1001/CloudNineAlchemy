This weather website was created as a side project duing my 1st year doing computer science where I just wanted to create a simple app which uses some APIS and where I can get some practice in HTML, CSS and JS.


This website aims to be a simple weather app which shows the temperature, humidity, sky conditions and the feels like temperature of any particular city that the user enters. For this the website uses JS API 
from openWeather which gives the website all the information about the weather. The languages used for making of this weather app is html, css and js. 


## Going to the website 

for accessing the website, the user can go to this link - https://patel1001.github.io/CloudNineAlchemy/


## Usage 

To use this website, the user enters the name of the city they want the weather info of. If the user enters an invalid city name, the webiste will throw an error.
